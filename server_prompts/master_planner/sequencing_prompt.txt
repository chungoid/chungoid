You are an expert AI project scheduler and workflow optimizer.

The overall user goal is: "{goal_description}".
We have decomposed this goal into the following tasks, and tentatively assigned agents/tools to each:
{tasks_to_sequence}
(Example format for each item:
- Task ID: [internal_task_id_or_index] 
  Description: "{{task_description}}"
  Assigned Agent(s): [{{agent_id_1}}, {{agent_id_2}} | NO_SUITABLE_AGENT]
  Justification: "{{agent_selection_justification}}")

Your objective is to determine the logical execution order for these tasks to achieve the overall user goal. 
Consider natural dependencies (e.g., you can't test code before it's written, you can't deploy before building).

For each task, specify its direct successor (the next task that should run). If a task is a final step in a sequence or for the overall plan, indicate this. If multiple tasks could logically follow, choose the most common or primary successor for a linear plan. Assume for now the system primarily executes a linear sequence, but note if true parallelism is obvious.

Respond with a JSON object where each key is a Task ID (from the input) and the value is an object containing the Task ID of its direct successor, or "FINAL_STEP" if it's a terminal task in the sequence.

Example Output Format:
{{
  "task_0": {{ "next_task_id": "task_2" }},
  "task_1": {{ "next_task_id": "task_0" }}, // Task 1 must complete before Task 0
  "task_2": {{ "next_task_id": "FINAL_STEP" }}
}}

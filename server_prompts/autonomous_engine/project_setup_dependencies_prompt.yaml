system_prompt: |
  You are a dependency management specialist within a consolidated project development agent.
  
  Your mission: Handle all dependency-related tasks for software projects with precision and security awareness.
  
  CAPABILITIES:
  - Analyze project requirements and identify dependencies
  - Create dependency files (requirements.txt, package.json, pom.xml, etc.)
  - Perform security audits and vulnerability checks
  - Manage version constraints and compatibility
  - Handle package manager configurations

user_prompt: |
  Manage dependencies for this project:

  **USER GOAL:** {{user_goal}}
  **PROJECT PATH:** {{project_path}}
  **PROJECT ID:** {{project_id}}
  **CAPABILITY:** {{capability}}

  **PROJECT CONTEXT:**
  {{project_context}}

  **DISCOVERED PROJECT STRUCTURE:**
  ```json
  {{discovery_results}}
  ```

  **DETECTED TECHNOLOGIES:**
  ```json
  {{technology_context}}
  ```

  **SETUP PREFERENCES:**
  ```json
  {{setup_preferences|tojson(indent=2)}}
  ```

  **INSTRUCTIONS:**
  Based on the discovered dependencies and technologies, manage the project's dependency requirements:

  1. **Analyze Discovered Dependencies**: Review what dependency files were found
  2. **Determine Package Managers**: Based on detected technologies, decide which package managers to use
  3. **Create/Update Dependency Files**: Generate or update appropriate dependency configuration
  4. **Follow User Preferences**: Respect installation and security preferences

  **RESPONSE FORMAT:**
  Return a JSON response with this exact structure:

    "reasoning": "Explanation based on discovered dependency files and user preferences"
  }
  ```

  **DEPENDENCY REQUIREMENTS:**
  - Use specific version ranges for stability
  - Include both production and development dependencies
  - Consider security implications
  - Follow package manager best practices
  - Document dependency rationale

  **Let the LLM intelligently decide what to do based on discovered patterns.**
  Return ONLY the JSON response, no additional text.

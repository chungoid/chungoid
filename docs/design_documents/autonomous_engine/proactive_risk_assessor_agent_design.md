## 1. Purpose & Scope

### 1.1. Purpose
The `ProactiveRiskAssessorAgent_v1` (PRAA) is designed to proactively analyze key project artifacts, primarily LOPRDs and Project Blueprints, to identify potential risks, inconsistencies, ambiguities, and high-return-on-investment (ROI) optimization opportunities. Its outputs guide the `AutomatedRefinementCoordinatorAgent` (ARCA) and other agents in refining these artifacts to improve project quality and reduce potential downstream issues.

### 1.2. Scope
#### 1.2.1. In Scope
*   Consuming LOPRDs (`llm_optimized_prd.json`) and Project Blueprints (`ProjectBlueprint.md`) as primary inputs via `ProjectChromaManagerAgent`.
*   Analyzing artifacts for:
    *   **Risks:** Technical feasibility, unclear requirements, potential integration challenges, performance bottlenecks, security vulnerabilities (at a conceptual level based on requirements/design), resource contention, dependency issues.
    *   **Inconsistencies:** Contradictions within the artifact or between the artifact and related documents (e.g., LOPRD vs. Blueprint).
    *   **Ambiguities:** Vague or unclear statements that could lead to misinterpretation.
    *   **Missing Information:** Critical details that seem to be omitted.
    *   **High-ROI Optimization Opportunities:** Suggestions for simplification, re-use, alternative approaches that could significantly improve efficiency, cost, or quality without derailing core objectives.
*   Generating structured reports:
    *   `RiskAssessmentReport.md`: Detailing identified risks, their potential impact, likelihood (qualitative), and suggested mitigation strategies.
    *   `HighROIOpportunitiesReport.md`: Detailing identified optimization opportunities, potential benefits, and high-level implementation ideas.
*   Storing these reports via `ProjectChromaManagerAgent`.
*   Providing a confidence score for its assessment.

#### 1.2.2. Out of Scope
*   Performing deep, quantitative risk analysis (e.g., Monte Carlo simulations).
*   Generating code or directly modifying the input artifacts (it suggests changes to ARCA).
*   Making final decisions on whether to implement optimizations or accept risks (this is ARCA's role, potentially with human oversight).
*   Conducting code-level security audits (that would be a more specialized agent later in the lifecycle).
*   Detailed test case generation.

## 2. High-Level Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD
    ARCA[AutomatedRefinementCoordinatorAgent] -- Analysis Request (Artifact ID) --> PRAA{ProactiveRiskAssessorAgent_v1};
    PRAA -.-> PCMA(ProjectChromaManagerAgent): Retrieve Artifact (LOPRD/Blueprint);
    PCMA --> PRAA: Artifact Content;
    PRAA -> LLM([LLM Model]): Analyze Artifact for Risks & Optimizations;
    LLM --> PRAA: Analysis Results + Confidence Hints;
    PRAA -- Generates --> RAR[RiskAssessmentReport.md];
    PRAA -- Generates --> HOR[HighROIOpportunitiesReport.md];
    PRAA -.-> PCMA: Store Reports & Confidence;
    PCMA --> ARCA: Report IDs & Confidence;
```
*ARCA requests PRAA to analyze an artifact. PRAA retrieves it via PCMA, uses an LLM for analysis, generates reports, and stores them back via PCMA. ARCA then uses these reports.*

## 3. Agent Responsibilities & Capabilities

### 3.1. Core Responsibilities (P3.M0.8.1)
*   Thoroughly analyze LOPRDs and Blueprints for potential issues and improvements.
*   Clearly articulate identified risks, their implications, and potential mitigations.
*   Clearly articulate optimization opportunities and their potential benefits.
*   Provide actionable insights to ARCA.

### 3.2. Key Capabilities
*   **Critical Analysis (LLM-driven):** Identify subtle risks, inconsistencies, and ambiguities in complex documents.
*   **Pattern Recognition:** Spot common anti-patterns or areas prone to issues in requirements/design.
*   **Optimization Identification:** Suggest creative or efficient alternatives.

## 5. API Contracts
*   PRAA is primarily orchestrated. It does not expose its own MCP tools.
*   It consumes services from `ProjectChromaManagerAgent`.

## 6. Key Algorithms & Logic Flows
1.  Receive `PRAATaskInput`.
2.  Retrieve target artifact (LOPRD/Blueprint) and any related documents from `ProjectChromaManagerAgent`.
3.  Construct a detailed prompt for the LLM, instructing it to analyze the artifact(s) for risks (feasibility, clarity, completeness, consistency, security concepts, etc.) and high-ROI optimizations. The prompt will guide the LLM on the desired structure of its findings (mimicking the report formats).
4.  Invoke LLM.
5.  Parse LLM response, potentially transforming it into the structured Markdown reports.
6.  Generate `RiskAssessmentReport.md` and `HighROIOpportunitiesReport.md`.
7.  Extract/derive an overall confidence score for the assessment.
8.  Store reports and confidence score via `ProjectChromaManagerAgent`.
9.  Return `PRAATaskOutput` with report Doc IDs and confidence.

## 7. Prompting Strategy & Templates

### 7.1. Core System Prompt
```text
You are ProactiveRiskAssessorAgent_v1 (PRAA), an expert AI in software project analysis. Your task is to meticulously review project artifacts like LOPRDs and Blueprints. Identify potential risks (technical, requirement-related, integration issues, conceptual security flaws, ambiguities, inconsistencies, missing information) and high-ROI optimization opportunities (simplifications, reusability, alternative approaches). Provide clear, actionable insights. For each identified risk, detail its description, location, potential impact, qualitative likelihood, and suggest mitigations. For each optimization, describe it, its benefits, and high-level implementation ideas. Structure your findings for `RiskAssessmentReport.md` and `HighROIOpportunitiesReport.md`. Conclude with an overall confidence assessment for your analysis (High/Medium/Low) and a brief justification.
```

### 7.2. Task-Specific Prompt Snippets (Examples for LLM interaction)
*For LOPRD Analysis:*
```text
Analyze the following LOPRD sections for risks and optimization opportunities:

LOPRD Content:
---
{{loprd_content_snippet}}
---

Focus on:
- Clarity and testability of requirements.
- Potential for conflicting requirements.
- Missing non-functional requirements.
- Feasibility concerns given common software development practices.
- Opportunities to simplify user stories or functional requirements without losing value.
```
*For Blueprint Analysis:*
```text
Analyze the following Project Blueprint sections (and consider its source LOPRD if provided) for risks and optimization opportunities:

Blueprint Content:
---
{{blueprint_content_snippet}}
---

LOPRD Context (Optional):
---
{{related_loprd_summary_or_key_sections}}
---

Focus on:
- Architectural soundness and completeness.
- Technical feasibility of proposed components and interactions.
- Potential integration challenges between components or with external systems.
- Scalability, performance, and security considerations implied by the design.
- Consistency with the LOPRD (if provided).
- Opportunities for using common design patterns, reusable components, or more efficient architectural choices.
```

### 7.3. Prompt Versioning & Management
*   Prompts will be versioned (e.g., `# Prompt Version: 0.1.0`).
*   Managed in `chungoid-core/server_prompts/autonomous_engine/proactive_risk_assessor_agent_v1.yaml`.

## 8. Interaction with `ProjectChromaManagerAgent` (P3.M0.8.2)

### 8.1. Data Read from ChromaDB
*   **Collection:** `project_planning_artifacts`
    *   **Data:** Content of LOPRD (`llm_optimized_prd.json`) or `ProjectBlueprint.md` (identified by `artifact_doc_id`).
    *   **Data:** Optionally, related LOPRD/Blueprint content for cross-referencing.
    *   **Purpose:** Primary input for risk/optimization analysis.

### 8.2. Data Written to ChromaDB
*   **Collection:** `risk_assessment_reports`
    *   **Data:** Generated `RiskAssessmentReport.md`.
    *   **Metadata:** `artifact_id` (of the report), `source_artifact_id` (of LOPRD/Blueprint analyzed), `agent_version`, `timestamp`, `confidence_score`.
*   **Collection:** `optimization_suggestion_reports`
    *   **Data:** Generated `HighROIOpportunitiesReport.md`.
    *   **Metadata:** `artifact_id` (of the report), `source_artifact_id` (of LOPRD/Blueprint analyzed), `agent_version`, `timestamp`, `confidence_score`.
*   **Collection:** `agent_reflections_and_logs`
    *   **Data:** Log of PRAA task, input IDs, output report IDs, confidence details.

## 9. Confidence Score Generation & Interpretation

### 9.1. Generation
*   The agent's prompt asks the LLM for an overall confidence in its assessment.
*   The wrapper code converts this verbal assessment (High/Medium/Low + justification) into the structured `ConfidenceScore` schema defined in `chungoid-core/src/chungoid/schemas/autonomous_engine/confidence_score_schema.json`.

### 9.2. Interpretation
*   PRAA does not primarily interpret confidence scores; it generates them for its own outputs. ARCA interprets these scores.

## 10. Error Handling, Resilience, and Retry Mechanisms
*   **Schema Validation Failure (LLM Output for Reports):** Attempt self-correction by re-prompting LLM with formatting guidance (1-2 retries).
*   **LLM API Errors:** Standard backoff/retry via LLM provider utility.
*   **ChromaDB Errors:** Report failure to ARCA if PCMA interactions fail.
*   Failure to parse critical sections of input artifacts may lead to lower confidence or an inability to perform assessment (reported as error).

## 11. Testing Strategy & Metrics
*   **Unit Tests:** Mock LLM, PCMA. Test prompt construction, report parsing, confidence extraction.
*   **Integration Tests:** Live LLM, PCMA. Provide sample LOPRDs/Blueprints. Verify:
    *   Plausible risks and optimizations are identified.
    *   Reports are generated in the correct format.
    *   Reports are stored correctly in ChromaDB.
*   **Key Metrics:**
    *   Relevance and actionability of identified risks/optimizations (qualitative human review initially).
    *   Coverage: Does it address different aspects of the input artifact?
    *   ARCA's ability to use the reports effectively (downstream metric).

## 12. Alternatives Considered & Rationale for Chosen Design
*   **Separate Agents for Risk vs. Optimization:** Considered, but a single agent can provide a more holistic analysis initially, as risks and optimizations are often related. Specialization can occur later if PRAA becomes too complex.
*   **Checklist-Based (Non-LLM) Analysis:** Could be used for very specific, common risks, but an LLM approach allows for more nuanced and emergent risk identification from diverse inputs.

## 13. Open Issues & Future Work
*   Fine-tuning prompts for varying levels of artifact detail and project complexity.
*   Developing a more quantitative approach to risk likelihood/impact if possible without excessive LLM hallucination.
*   Integrating with a knowledge base of common software risks and best practices to improve LLM analysis.
*   Allowing PRAA to suggest specific queries to `ProjectChromaManagerAgent` to gather more context if it detects missing information.

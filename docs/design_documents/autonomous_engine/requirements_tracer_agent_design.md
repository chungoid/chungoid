## 1. Purpose & Scope

### 1.1. Purpose (P3.M0.10.1)
The `RequirementsTracerAgent_v1` (RTA) is responsible for verifying and reporting on the traceability of requirements through different stages of project artifact generation. Initially, it focuses on ensuring that elements from an LOPRD are adequately addressed in the Project Blueprint, and subsequently, that elements from the Blueprint are represented in the Master Execution Plan. This helps maintain alignment and ensures that the project stays true to its original goals as it progresses through design and planning phases.

### 1.2. Scope
#### 1.2.1. In Scope
*   Consuming LOPRDs (`llm_optimized_prd.json`), Project Blueprints (`ProjectBlueprint.md`), and Master Execution Plans (`MasterExecutionPlan.yaml`) as inputs via `ProjectChromaManagerAgent`.
*   **LOPRD -> Blueprint Traceability:**
    *   Identifying key requirements (e.g., User Stories, Functional Requirements, Non-Functional Requirements) in the LOPRD.
    *   Analyzing the Project Blueprint to determine if and how these LOPRD requirements are addressed by architectural components, modules, or design decisions.
*   **Blueprint -> Plan Traceability:**
    *   Identifying key architectural components, modules, or significant design elements in the Project Blueprint.
    *   Analyzing the Master Execution Plan (e.g., stages, tasks, agent assignments) to determine if these Blueprint elements are adequately covered by planned work.
*   Identifying and reporting:
    *   **Covered Requirements/Components:** Elements that are adequately traced.
    *   **Missing/Untraced Requirements/Components:** Elements from the source document (LOPRD/Blueprint) that do not appear to be addressed in the target document (Blueprint/Plan).
    *   **Partial Coverage:** Elements that are only partially addressed.
    *   **Potential Misalignments:** Instances where the target document seems to deviate from or contradict the source document's intent regarding a specific element.
*   Generating a structured `TraceabilityReport.md` detailing these findings.
*   Storing the report via `ProjectChromaManagerAgent`.
*   Providing a confidence score for its traceability analysis.

#### 1.2.2. Out of Scope
*   Verifying the *correctness* or *quality* of how a requirement is implemented or planned (that is the role of other agents like PRAA, code reviewers, or ARCA's overall assessment).
*   Tracing requirements directly into code or test cases (this could be a future, more advanced RTA capability or handled by other specialized agents).
*   Generating the LOPRD, Blueprint, or Plan (it only analyzes existing ones).
*   Making decisions based on the traceability report (ARCA uses the report for decision-making).
*   Deep semantic understanding equivalent to a human expert; the initial version will rely on LLM capabilities for matching and identifying relationships based on textual similarity, keywords, and explicit references if present.

## 2. High-Level Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD
    ARCA[AutomatedRefinementCoordinatorAgent] -- Analysis Request (Source & Target Artifact IDs) --> RTA{RequirementsTracerAgent_v1};
    RTA -.-> PCMA(ProjectChromaManagerAgent): Retrieve Source Artifact (e.g., LOPRD);
    RTA -.-> PCMA: Retrieve Target Artifact (e.g., Blueprint);
    PCMA --> RTA: Source Artifact Content;
    PCMA --> RTA: Target Artifact Content;
    RTA -> LLM([LLM Model]): Analyze for Traceability;
    LLM --> RTA: Traceability Findings + Confidence Hints;
    RTA -- Generates --> TR[TraceabilityReport.md];
    RTA -.-> PCMA: Store Report & Confidence;
    PCMA --> ARCA: Report ID & Confidence;
```
*ARCA requests RTA to analyze traceability between two artifacts. RTA retrieves them via PCMA, uses an LLM for analysis, generates a report, and stores it back via PCMA. ARCA then uses this report.*

## 3. Agent Responsibilities & Capabilities

### 3.1. Core Responsibilities (P3.M0.10.1)
*   Systematically compare related project artifacts to identify traceability links.
*   Report clearly on the extent to which requirements or design elements are carried forward.
*   Provide actionable information to ARCA regarding potential gaps or misalignments in project documentation.

### 3.2. Key Capabilities
*   **Artifact Comparison (LLM-driven):** Identify conceptual links between elements in different documents (e.g., a user story in LOPRD and a module description in a Blueprint).
*   **Gap Identification:** Pinpoint requirements or components that lack corresponding elements in subsequent artifacts.
*   **Structured Reporting:** Produce a clear, organized `TraceabilityReport.md`.
*   **Element Extraction:** Identify key items (user stories, FRs, NFRs, architectural components, plan tasks) from structured and semi-structured documents.

## 3. RTA Confidence & Methodology Notes
[Brief notes on how the RTA performed the analysis, any assumptions made, or limitations of this report.]
```

## 5. API Contracts
*   RTA is primarily orchestrated. It does not expose its own MCP tools.
*   It consumes services from `ProjectChromaManagerAgent`.

## 6. Key Algorithms & Logic Flows (P3.M0.10.2)

1.  Receive `RTATaskInput`.
2.  Retrieve source and target artifacts from `ProjectChromaManagerAgent`.
3.  **Element Extraction:**
    *   Parse the source artifact (LOPRD/Blueprint) to identify key traceable elements (e.g., LOPRD: user stories, FRs, NFRs with their IDs; Blueprint: components, modules, key interfaces with their names/IDs).
    *   Parse the target artifact (Blueprint/Plan) to identify its key elements.
4.  **Traceability Analysis (LLM-driven):**
    *   For each key element in the source artifact, construct a prompt for the LLM.
    *   The prompt asks the LLM to search/analyze the target artifact to find corresponding elements that address or implement the source element.
    *   The LLM should be guided to identify full coverage, partial coverage, or no coverage, and provide brief justifications or pointers to sections in the target document.
    *   The prompt might also ask to identify potential misalignments if a target element seems to contradict a source element.
    *   Example sub-prompt: "Does the provided Project Blueprint address LOPRD Functional Requirement FR023: 'The system must allow users to reset their password'? If so, which Blueprint components or sections are responsible? If not, or only partially, explain."
5.  **Collate Findings:** Aggregate the LLM's responses for all source elements.
6.  **Generate Report:** Structure the findings into the `TraceabilityReport.md` format, including summaries and detailed lists.
7.  **Calculate Heuristic Score:** Develop a simple heuristic for an `overall_traceability_score` (e.g., based on percentage of fully/partially traced items).
8.  Generate an overall confidence score for the RTA's analysis process.
9.  Store the report and confidence score via `ProjectChromaManagerAgent`.
10. Return `RTATaskOutput`.

## 7. Prompting Strategy & Templates

### 7.1. Core System Prompt
```text
You are RequirementsTracerAgent_v1 (RTA), an AI expert in software requirements traceability. Your task is to analyze two project artifacts: a source document (e.g., LOPRD or Project Blueprint) and a target document (e.g., Project Blueprint or Master Execution Plan). 

For each key requirement or component identified in the source document, you must determine if it is adequately addressed, partially addressed, or not addressed (a gap) in the target document. You should also identify any potential misalignments where the target seems to contradict the source. 

Structure your findings clearly in a traceability report format. For each source element, specify its trace status to the target, citing specific target elements if a link exists. Conclude with an overall confidence assessment (High/Medium/Low) for your analysis and a brief justification.
```

### 7.2. Task-Specific Prompt Templates (Examples for LLM interaction)
*For LOPRD User Story to Blueprint traceability:*
```text
Source LOPRD User Story:
ID: {{US_ID}}
Title: {{US_TITLE}}
Description: {{US_DESCRIPTION}}

Target Project Blueprint (Excerpt or Full):
{{BLUEPRINT_CONTENT}}

Is this User Story addressed in the Project Blueprint? 
- If yes (fully or partially), which Blueprint components, modules, or sections cover it? Explain briefly.
- If no, state that it appears to be a gap.
- Note any potential misalignments.
```
*For Blueprint Component to Master Execution Plan traceability:*
```text
Source Blueprint Component:
Name: {{COMPONENT_NAME}}
Description: {{COMPONENT_DESCRIPTION}}
Responsibilities: {{COMPONENT_RESPONSIBILITIES}}

Target Master Execution Plan (Excerpt or Full):
{{PLAN_CONTENT}}

Is this Blueprint Component planned for development/integration in the Master Execution Plan? 
- If yes (fully or partially), which Plan stages, tasks, or deliverables cover it? Explain briefly.
- If no, state that it appears to be a gap.
```

### 7.3. Prompt Versioning & Management
*   Prompts will be versioned (e.g., `# Prompt Version: 0.1.0`).
*   Managed in `chungoid-core/server_prompts/autonomous_engine/requirements_tracer_agent_v1.yaml`.

## 8. Interaction with `ProjectChromaManagerAgent` (P3.M0.10.2)

### 8.1. Data Read from ChromaDB
*   **Collection:** `project_planning_artifacts`
    *   **Data:** Content of source LOPRD/Blueprint and target Blueprint/Plan (identified by `*_doc_id` in input).
    *   **Purpose:** Primary inputs for traceability analysis.

### 8.2. Data Written to ChromaDB
*   **Collection:** `traceability_reports`
    *   **Data:** Generated `TraceabilityReport.md`.
    *   **Metadata:** `artifact_id` (of the report), `source_artifact_id`, `target_artifact_id`, `agent_version`, `timestamp`, `confidence_score`, `overall_traceability_score`.
*   **Collection:** `agent_reflections_and_logs`
    *   **Data:** Log of RTA task, input IDs, output report ID, confidence details.

## 9. Confidence Score Generation & Interpretation

### 9.1. Generation
*   The agent's prompt asks the LLM for an overall confidence in its traceability assessment.
*   The wrapper code converts this verbal assessment into the structured `ConfidenceScore` schema.
*   The `overall_traceability_score` is a heuristic calculated by RTA based on the percentage of traced items.

### 9.2. Interpretation
*   RTA does not primarily interpret confidence scores; it generates them for its own outputs. ARCA interprets these scores.

## 10. Error Handling, Resilience, and Retry Mechanisms
*   **Failure to Parse Artifacts:** If RTA cannot extract key elements from source/target documents, it will report an error or produce a report with very low confidence, indicating inability to perform analysis.
*   **LLM API Errors:** Standard backoff/retry.
*   **ChromaDB Errors:** Report failure to ARCA if PCMA interactions fail.

## 11. Testing Strategy & Metrics
*   **Unit Tests:** Mock LLM, PCMA. Test element extraction logic (e.g., from sample LOPRD JSON or Blueprint Markdown), prompt construction, report parsing from LLM mock output, heuristic score calculation.
*   **Integration Tests:** Live LLM, PCMA. Provide sample LOPRD-Blueprint pairs and Blueprint-Plan pairs with known traceability links and gaps. Verify:
    *   Correct identification of traced items, partial traces, and gaps.
    *   Report format and content accuracy.
    *   Plausible confidence scores.
*   **Key Metrics:**
    *   Accuracy of traceability links identified (precision/recall against a ground truth for test cases).
    *   Completeness of gap identification.
    *   Clarity and usefulness of the `TraceabilityReport.md` for ARCA.

## 12. Alternatives Considered & Rationale for Chosen Design
*   **Keyword/Embedding-Based Matching without Explicit LLM Analysis per Element:** Could be faster for an initial pass but might miss nuanced relationships or produce more false positives/negatives. LLM analysis per key element, while slower, allows for more targeted reasoning.
*   **Formal Requirements Modeling Language:** Using a formal language for requirements could make tracing deterministic but adds significant overhead to LOPRD/Blueprint generation and is not the current approach.

## 13. Open Issues & Future Work
*   Handling very large artifacts efficiently (e.g., techniques for summarizing or chunking target documents for LLM analysis if full context is too large).
*   Improving the sophistication of element extraction from diverse artifact structures.
*   Bidirectional traceability (e.g., checking if everything in the Blueprint *also* maps back to an LOPRD requirement, not just LOPRD->Blueprint).
*   Traceability into code and test artifacts.
*   More robust heuristics for the `overall_traceability_score`.
